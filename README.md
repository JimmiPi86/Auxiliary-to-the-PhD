# Auxiliary-to-the-PhD
Auxiliary codes for extracting data from SAFT and creating graphs, counting A and Kt coefficients
Included in these files are the codes that I used helpfully:
- plots: generates graphs, Excel is cumbersome and did not allow to easily add subscripts, etc. I used here the syntax of the TeX language

- PC_SAFT_CATCHER - for dimensioning and data extraction from the PC SAFT method, generating variables in a quasi-continuous manner to the dimension of the experimental/literature data table;

- Thermoelastic_calc - to count thermoelastic derivatives: Alpha_p and Kappa_T and Kappa_s. The methods used were numerical differentiation
